## 🔧 Pending Issues & Future Improvements

- **Dark Mode Support**: Currently, the library does not support dark mode. Adding dark mode is a high-priority enhancement for future releases.
- **More Components**: Expanding the library with additional components like a Tooltip, or Loading Bar.
- **Theming Support**: Allowing global customization of default styles (e.g., colors, fonts) through a theme provider.
- **Setup Proper Build Pipeline**: Currently I created the NPM package by manually copying the files to a separate folder. This could be changed to a single command and a single repo.
